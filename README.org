* TxCheck

** Description
TxCheck is a tool for finding transctional bugs in database management systems. It uses SQL-level instrumentation to capture statement-level dependencies and construct transactional oracle to find bugs in transaction supports of DBMSs. We implemented TxCheck on the top of SQLsmith (https://github.com/anse1/sqlsmith).
